# Introduction

I live in Orlando Florida, which is less than an hour away from Cape Canaveral. As you might imagine, visiting the space center and watching launches is a "thing" we Orlando folks do fairly often.

Me. A long time ago. Pretending to be too close to a launch by posing in front of a photo framed at the Kennedy Space Center. Meta.

I've also been getting into R and data science recently via Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's excellent _R for Data Science_. To apply the things I'm learning, I thought it'd be fun to analyze [this week's Tidy Tuesday astronauts dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-14/readme.md). 

I'll follow the analysis process suggested by _R for Data Science_:

1. Import/Tidy
1. Explore (via Transforming, Visualizing, and Modeling the data)
1. Repeat exploration loop.
1. Communicate results.

If you're not interested in the journey, you can skip to [the results](#results). The graphs are cleaner and there's no code to clutter things.

# Load and Tidy

```{r message=F}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-07-14')
```
Let's `glimpse` our data:

```{r}
astronauts <- tuesdata$astronauts 
glimpse(astronauts)
```

Each row is an astronaut and the mission they accomplished. Columns are variables whose meaning is fairly clear from the name, with the exception of `field21`. 

Let's rename it. The docs say that it represents "Instances of EVA by mission.":

```{r}
astronauts <- astronauts %>% 
  rename(evas_by_mission = field21)
```


# Exploration Loop 1

I'm curious what the spread of astronauts is by sex.

```{r}
astronauts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sex)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Unfortunately, this isn't surprising. I wonder if the ratio of male to female astronauts has become more equal over time.[^1] Let's see:

[^1]: I'm going to have a daughter soon, and if she wants to be an astronaut, I sure hope she doesn't have to deal with any bias.

```{r}
astronauts %>%
  ggplot(aes(year_of_mission, color = sex)) +
  geom_bar()
```

It's not crystal clear from here whether the ratio has improved over time. Let's confirm explicitly by creating, plotting, and fitting a line to a ratio variable.

```{r}
astronauts %>%
  group_by(year_of_mission) %>% 
  summarise(ratio = sum(sex == "female") / sum(sex == "male")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year_of_mission, ratio)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = F)
```
Looks like there was more equality since the 60s, but there may be some tapering off starting in the 2000s. 

What the heck happened in ~1960? That's an unusually high ratio.  

```{r}
astronauts %>% 
  filter(between(year_of_mission, 1960, 1970)) %>% 
  group_by(year_of_mission) %>% 
  count(sex)
```

Ah. Only three astronauts went on missions in 1963 and one of them was female. Makes sense now.

# Exploration Loop 2

I'm curious what the spread of astronauts is by nationality.

```{r}
astronauts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(nationality)) +
  geom_bar()
```

That's not useful. Let's drop nationalities that appear less than 10 times in the dataset, flip the axis, and sort.

```{r}
astronauts %>% 
  add_count(nationality) %>% 
  filter(n > 10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(nationality, n))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```

Better. Looks like the US dominates missions overall. 

Let's try looking at the the ratio of US astronauts on missions over time:

```{r}
astronauts %>%
  group_by(year_of_mission) %>% 
  summarise(ratio = sum(nationality == "U.S.") / n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year_of_mission, ratio)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = F)
```

Interesting. I didn't realize the U.S. peaked in terms of share of astronauts sent to space in the mid-90s. This makes me wonder how the number of U.S. missions have changed over time.

```{r}
astronauts %>% 
  count(year_of_mission, wt = sum(nationality == "U.S.")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year_of_mission, n)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = F)
```
Super interesting! I remember thinking that Obama's shutting of the shuttle program would be an inflection point of NASA's activity, but this suggests that the inflection point was before Obama was even elected: ~1994.

# Results

This data set suggests three interesting conclusions:

## 1. Female astronauts have made up a minor, but increasing share of astronauts since the 60s, but that trend has reversed since the late 90s

You can kind of see this in this graph:

```{r echo=F}
astronauts %>%
  ggplot(aes(year_of_mission, color = sex)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Share of Female Astronauts from 1960-2020",
       subtitle = "(color-coded by sex)",
       x = "Year of Mission",
       y = "Number of Astronauts")
```

But it becomes very clear in this graph:

```{r echo=F, message=F}
astronauts %>%
  group_by(year_of_mission) %>% 
  summarise(ratio = sum(sex == "female") / sum(sex == "male")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year_of_mission, ratio)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  labs(
    title = "Ratio of female to male astronauts over time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Ratio"
    )
```

## 2. The U.S.'s dominance in share of astronauts ended in the late 90s

```{r echo=F, message=F}
astronauts %>%
  group_by(year_of_mission) %>% 
  summarise(ratio = sum(nationality == "U.S.") / n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year_of_mission, ratio)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  labs(
    title = "Ratio of U.S. astronauts over time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Ratio"
  )
```

## 3. The raw number of U.S. astronauts on missions has been in decline since the late 90s, long before Obama [cancelled the Constellation Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_program)

```{r echo=F, message=F}
astronauts %>% 
  count(year_of_mission, wt = sum(nationality == "U.S.")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year_of_mission, n)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of US Astronauts on missions Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of US Astronauts on missions"
  )
```
